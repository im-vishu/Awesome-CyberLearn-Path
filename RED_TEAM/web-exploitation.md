# 🌐 Web Exploitation — Practical Lab Guide (Lab-Only)

> Mentor-style, hands-on guide. Only practice these techniques in authorized labs (TryHackMe, HackTheBox, Juice Shop) or on systems you own and have written permission to test.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This guide teaches practical web application testing: how to discover vulnerabilities, validate them safely, and write clear remediation guidance. Focus on methodology: recon → enumerate → validate → exploit → report.

**Outcome:** After completing the tasks here, you’ll be able to run web recon, identify OWASP Top 10 issues, produce safe proof-of-concept validations, and write concise remediation recommendations.

---

## ⚖️ Legal & Ethical Reminder

* Do not test live websites or services without explicit written permission.
* Use isolated lab environments (Juice Shop, DVWA, local containers).
* Sanitize screenshots and redact sensitive data in writeups.

## 🧭 Web Testing Methodology

1. **Scope & Rules of Engagement** — confirm allowed targets, data handling, and reporting expectations.
2. **Passive Recon** — robots.txt, sitemap.xml, public endpoints, JS analysis for API endpoints.
3. **Active Enumeration** — directory brute force, parameter enumeration, input points mapping.
4. **Vulnerability Validation** — use safe PoC methods (non-destructive) to confirm an issue.
5. **Exploit Carefully** — limit impact and document steps.
6. **Report** — include steps to reproduce, impact, and remediation.

---

## 🧪 Hands-on Tasks (Lab-Only)

### Task A — Recon & Mapping (1–2 hours)

* Run `curl` on `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`.
* Load the app in a browser, capture traffic with Burp, and map all endpoints.
* Extract JS files and search for hidden API endpoints or keys.

### Task B — Directory & Parameter Enumeration (1–2 hours)

* Run `ffuf` or `gobuster` to discover directories:

```bash
ffuf -u http://10.10.10.5/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 50
```

* Identify parameters in GET/POST requests that accept user input.

### Task C — OWASP Top 10 Validation (2–4 hours)

* Test for SQL Injection (safe tests) using Burp Repeater and validate with error-based or time-based techniques in a lab.
* Test for XSS by injecting benign scripts (`<script>alert(1)</script>`) into input fields in Juice Shop.
* Test for IDOR by changing object IDs in requests and observing access control bypass.

### Task D — API & Auth Testing (1–2 hours)

* Use Postman to test authentication endpoints for missing rate limits or weak password policies.
* Check token expiration and refresh logic for predictable tokens.

### Task E — Automated Scanning & Verification (1 hour)

* Run OWASP ZAP or Burp Scanner against the lab app and compare results with your manual findings.

## 📦 Deliverables

* `web-vuln-report.md` that includes:

  * Scope & lab used
  * Vulnerability summary: title, impact, reproducible steps (sanitized)
  * Screenshots (sanitized) and request highlights
  * Remediation recommendations (fixes and validation steps)
* Optional: small exploit script or Burp macro (safe and non-destructive)

---

## 💡 Hints & Safe Testing Practices

* Prefer non-destructive payloads first (alerts, benign strings).
* For SQLi, prefer time-based proofs in labs (e.g., `SLEEP(5)`) to avoid data corruption.
* Use Burp's Collaborator for blind injection detections in isolated labs.
* Keep a changelog of every test and who authorized it.

---

## 🧠 Common Vulnerabilities & Quick Checks

* **SQL Injection:** test inputs that interact with DB-backed queries.
* **XSS (Reflected/Stored):** test form inputs, comment fields, search values.
* **CSRF:** check for missing anti-CSRF tokens on state-changing requests.
* **Auth Issues:** broken auth, session fixation, weak password policies.
* **File Uploads:** verify content-type checks, storage location, and executable prevention.

---

## 🔐 Remediation Recommendations (Short)

* Parameterized queries / prepared statements for DB interactions.
* Output encoding and input validation for XSS mitigation.
* Implement CSRF tokens and SameSite cookie flags.
* Enforce strong password policies, MFA, and session timeouts.
* Validate and sanitize file uploads; store outside web root and scan uploads.

> Web testing is a mix of curiosity and restraint. Break things only in safe places — and always tell developers how to fix them.
