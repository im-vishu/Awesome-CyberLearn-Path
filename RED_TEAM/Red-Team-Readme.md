# 💀 Red Team — Offensive Security Track

This folder focuses on offensive security: reconnaissance, exploitation, privilege escalation, and professional pentest reporting.
Content is mentor-style and designed for learners who understand the legal and ethical boundaries of offensive work.

## ⚖️ Legal & Ethical Reminder

Only practice offensive techniques in **authorized labs** (TryHackMe, HackTheBox, VulnHub) or on assets you own. Never attack public or production systems without explicit written consent.
