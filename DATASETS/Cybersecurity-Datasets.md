# ğŸ“Š Cybersecurity Datasets â€” Open, Safe & Educational

This folder curates open datasets for hands-on cybersecurity learning, research, and analytics â€” ideal for practicing malware classification, network traffic analysis, phishing detection, or SOC automation.

Each dataset listed here is **publicly available** and intended for **education, research, and simulation** â€” not for real-world offensive use. Always review dataset licenses and handle any malware or packet captures in isolated virtual environments.

## ğŸ§­ How to Use These Datasets Safely

1. **Work in a sandbox or VM** â€” use VirtualBox, VMware, or cloud sandboxes.
2. **Never execute unknown binaries or attachments** on your host machine.
3. **Check data usage policies** â€” some datasets are restricted to academic use.
4. **Document every analysis** â€” track hashes, patterns, and tools used.
5. **When in doubt, analyze offline.**

## ğŸ§  Pro Tips for Researchers

* Convert CSV logs into visual dashboards (Splunk, ELK, Grafana).
* Combine datasets with OSINT feeds for deeper threat context.
* Document hash and source for traceability.
* Use Jupyter notebooks or Pandas for quick parsing and modeling.
