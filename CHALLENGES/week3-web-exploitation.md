# 💻 Week 3 — Web Exploitation Basics

## 🎯 Goal

Understand how web applications work and where they fail. This week, you’ll explore the **OWASP Top 10** vulnerabilities hands-on — learning how they appear, how to identify them, and how developers can fix them.

**Outcome:** You’ll gain the ability to analyze, exploit, and report common web security flaws in a controlled, ethical environment.

## 🧪 Tasks

1. **Set up your environment:** Run OWASP Juice Shop locally using Docker or in TryHackMe.
2. **Intercept traffic:** Configure Burp Suite proxy and capture login requests.
3. **Identify vulnerabilities:**

   * SQL Injection (Login bypass)
   * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
   * Broken Authentication (reuse weak creds)
   * Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
4. **Automated scan:** Run a quick scan using OWASP ZAP and interpret the findings.
5. **Report writing:** For two discovered issues, explain *what the vulnerability is*, *how it can be exploited*, and *how to fix it*.

---

## 💡 Hints

* In Burp, right-click any request → *Send to Repeater* to test inputs.
* For SQLi testing, use `' OR 1=1--` (in safe, offline labs only).
* Always test in **Juice Shop** or **TryHackMe** environments — never on real websites.

---

## 📦 Deliverables

* A Markdown report (`web-vuln-report.md`) including:

  * 2–3 vulnerabilities identified
  * Screenshot of Burp/ZAP findings
  * Fix recommendation for each
* Optional: Short demo clip (GIF or screenshot series).

## 🧠 Reflection

At the end of this week, you should be able to:

* Understand how web requests and responses work.
* Intercept and manipulate requests safely.
* Identify and explain core web vulnerabilities.

> The web is where attackers learn precision — every request teaches you how systems really work.
