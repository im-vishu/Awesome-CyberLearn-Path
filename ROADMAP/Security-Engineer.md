# 🧱 Security Engineer Roadmap — Build, Break, and Secure Systems

Welcome to the **Security Engineer Roadmap** — the path for developers, sysadmins, or curious minds who want to design and secure entire systems.
This track blends **engineering**, **defensive security**, and **DevSecOps** principles to help you build *secure-by-design* environments.

Timeline: **9–12 months** (hands-on learning recommended).

---

## 🎯 What a Security Engineer Does

Security Engineers are responsible for building, implementing, and maintaining security controls.
They don’t just react to incidents — they *prevent* them by design.

Your work might include:

* Securing cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP)
* Implementing CI/CD security scans
* Hardening networks, servers, and containers
* Automating compliance and vulnerability management

---

## 🪜 Phase 1: Foundation (Month 1–2)

> Build strong fundamentals across systems and networking.

### 🧠 Learn

* OS basics: Linux administration, Windows internals
* Networking: firewalls, VPN, routing, DNS, subnets
* Secure configurations: SSH, TLS, IAM permissions

### 🧰 Tools

* Nmap, Wireshark, Sysmon, UFW
* Docker, Kubernetes (basics)
* Git and CI/CD workflows (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)

### 🧪 Labs

* [TryHackMe: Security Operations](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/soclevel1)
* [OverTheWire: Bandit + Narnia](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)

## 🧩 Phase 2: Secure Coding & DevSecOps (Month 3–5)

> Combine development with security automation.

### 🧠 Learn

* Common coding vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
* Static and dynamic code analysis
* Secrets management (Vault, AWS KMS)
* Pipeline security (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning)

### 🧰 Tools

* SonarQube, Snyk, GitHub Dependabot
* Trivy, Clair (container scanners)
* HashiCorp Vault

### 🧪 Practice

* [PortSwigger Web Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security)
* [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/)
* [GitHub Actions Security Labs](https://github.com/marketplace/actions)

### 🎓 Certifications (Optional)

* [eJPT](https://security.ine.com/certifications/ejpt-certification/)
* [AWS Certified Security – Specialty](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-security-specialty/)

---

## ⚙️ Phase 3: Cloud Security & Infrastructure Hardening (Month 6–8)

> Secure the backbone — cloud, containers, and networks.

### 🧠 Key Topics

* IAM best practices & least privilege
* VPC design & firewall rules
* Kubernetes security, container scanning
* Cloud incident response

### 🧰 Tools

* ScoutSuite, Prowler, CloudGoat
* AWS Config, GuardDuty, SecurityHub
* kube-bench, Falco

### 🧪 Labs

* [CloudGoat](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/cloudgoat)
* [Kubernetes Goat](https://madhuakula.com/kubernetes-goat/)
* [AWS Skill Builder Labs](https://aws.amazon.com/training/)

---

## 🚀 Phase 4: Automation & Security Architecture (Month 9–12)

> Turn your knowledge into scalable systems.

### 🧠 Learn

* Threat modeling & security architecture
* Automating compliance checks
* Writing Infrastructure-as-Code securely (Terraform)
* Building centralized monitoring (SIEM + SOAR)

### 🧰 Tools

* Terraform, Ansible
* ELK / Wazuh / Splunk
* Python or Bash for automation scripts

### 🧪 Projects

* Build a **secure CI/CD pipeline** using GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
* Design a **multi-layer cloud architecture** with IAM & network segmentation.
* Create an **alerting & monitoring dashboard** using Wazuh or ELK.

### 🎓 Certifications (Optional)

* [CompTIA CySA+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/cybersecurity-analyst)
* [GCP Professional Cloud Security Engineer](https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-security-engineer)

---

## 🧾 Portfolio Ideas

* ☁️ **Secure Cloud Infrastructure Repo** — Terraform code with least-privilege IAM.
* 🧰 **CI/CD Security Pipeline Demo** — Include screenshots and workflow.
* 📊 **SIEM + Dashboard Project** — Custom Wazuh/Splunk dashboard.

> Your portfolio should prove you can *build securely* — not just talk about it.

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* Stay curious — learn how each tool interacts with systems.
* Document every config change and its purpose.
* Follow [OWASP DevSecOps Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-devsecops-guideline/).
* Join **Discords/Communities:** DevSecOps Guild, Cloud Security Forum.

**Goal:** become job-ready for **Security Engineer / DevSecOps Intern** roles within 12 months.
