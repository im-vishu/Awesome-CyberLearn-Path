# 🛡️ SOC Analyst Roadmap — From Beginner to Tier 1 Hero

Welcome to your **SOC Analyst Roadmap**, designed to take you from zero to employable in about **6–9 months**.
If you like solving puzzles, staying calm under pressure, and defending real systems — this is your track.

---

## 🎯 What a SOC Analyst Does

A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is where defenders monitor, detect, and respond to cyber threats.
As an analyst, you’ll:

* Monitor alerts and logs from SIEM tools (like Splunk or Wazuh)
* Investigate suspicious behavior
* Escalate or respond to incidents
* Write reports and playbooks

Your goal: learn to **spot, analyze, and stop** malicious activity.

---

## 🪜 Phase 1: Foundations (Month 1–2)

> Learn how computers, networks, and logs actually work.

### 🧠 Key Topics

* Operating systems (Windows, Linux)
* Networking basics: TCP/IP, ports, protocols
* Common attacks (phishing, brute-force, malware)
* Cyber kill chain & MITRE ATT&CK basics

### 🧰 Tools

* Wireshark, TCPdump
* Sysinternals Suite
* Event Viewer (Windows)

### 🧪 Practice

* [TryHackMe: SOC Level 1 Path](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/soclevel1)
* [OverTheWire: Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)

### 🎓 Certification (Optional)

* [CompTIA Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security) – solid entry-level cert.

---

## 🧩 Phase 2: Detection & Monitoring (Month 3–4)

> Start thinking like a defender — recognize signs of attack in logs and alerts.

### 🧠 Key Topics

* SIEM basics: log ingestion, correlation, and alerting
* Endpoint detection (EDR)
* Incident lifecycle (Detection → Containment → Recovery)
* Understanding alerts (false positive vs. real threat)

### 🧰 Tools

* Splunk (Free Trial / [Splunk Fundamentals 1 Course](https://education.splunk.com))
* Wazuh SIEM ([Official Docs](https://documentation.wazuh.com))
* ELK Stack (Elastic, Logstash, Kibana)

### 🧪 Labs

* [CyberDefenders BlueYard Labs](https://cyberdefenders.org)
* [Blue Team Labs Online](https://blueteamlabs.online)

### 📘 Deliverable

Build your first **alert triage report** — screenshot + summary of what you found.

---

## ⚙️ Phase 3: Incident Response (Month 5–6)

> Step into real-world response scenarios.

### 🧠 Key Topics

* Memory analysis, malware triage, IOC extraction
* Threat hunting fundamentals
* Forensics basics (Windows event analysis)

### 🧰 Tools

* Autopsy / Volatility
* MISP (threat intelligence)
* Wireshark + Zeek for network forensics

### 🧪 Practice

* [TryHackMe: Blue Team Labs](https://tryhackme.com/module/blue-team)
* [CyberDefenders Incident Response Labs](https://cyberdefenders.org)

### 🎓 Certifications (Optional)

* [Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1)](https://securityblue.team/btl1/)
* [GCFA or GCIH (Advanced)](https://www.giac.org/)

---

## 🚀 Phase 4: Threat Hunting & Automation (Month 7–9)

> You’re no longer reacting — you’re proactively hunting.

### 🧠 Key Topics

* Threat intelligence lifecycle
* Writing Sigma rules / YARA signatures
* SIEM automation (using Python or SPL)
* Incident playbook creation

### 🧰 Tools

* Sigma HQ ([sigmahq.io](https://sigmahq.io))
* MISP Threat Intel Platform
* Python (for automating log parsing)

### 🧪 Projects

* Create your own **SOC Dashboard** using ELK or Splunk.
* Write 2–3 custom Sigma rules and test them.

---

## 🧾 Portfolio Ideas

* 📊 **SIEM Dashboard Project** — visualize brute-force or phishing alerts.
* 🧰 **Incident Response Report** — write-up from a TryHackMe or Blue Team Labs challenge.
* 🧠 **Threat Hunt Notebook** — Python notebook that identifies suspicious log patterns.

> Tip: Document everything — screenshots, notes, and reflections. Recruiters love clean, documented projects.

---

## 🏁 Final Advice

* Don’t rush — depth beats speed.
* Join SOC communities: [Reddit r/blueteamsec](https://www.reddit.com/r/blueteamsec/), [Discord: Blue Team Village](https://blueteamvillage.org).
* Practice 30 mins daily — even log parsing builds intuition.

**Goal:** land your first SOC L1 or Blue Team internship within 9 months.
