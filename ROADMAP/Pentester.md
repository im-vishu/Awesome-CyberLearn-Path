# 💀 Penetration Tester (Red Team) Roadmap — From Curious Learner to Ethical Hacker

Welcome to your **Pentester Roadmap** — the journey to becoming a professional ethical hacker.
You’ll learn how to think like an attacker, test security defenses, and build real-world offensive security projects.
If you love breaking things to make them stronger — this is your path.

Estimated timeline: **8–12 months** (consistent, hands-on practice).

---

## 🎯 What a Penetration Tester Does

Penetration testers (also known as **Red Teamers**) simulate attacks to find vulnerabilities before criminals do.
They:

* Assess networks, applications, and systems for weaknesses.
* Exploit those vulnerabilities safely (under contract).
* Write detailed remediation reports.

You’re part of the *offensive security* team — but you play for the defense.

---

## 🪜 Phase 1: Core Foundations (Month 1–2)

> Understand how systems communicate and break.

### 🧠 Learn These First

* Linux basics (terminal, file system, permissions)
* Networking 101: IP, DNS, HTTP, ports, routing
* Common vulnerabilities: SQLi, XSS, CSRF, LFI, RCE
* Basics of web technologies (HTML, JS, HTTP requests)

### 🧰 Tools

* Nmap, Netcat, Burp Suite, Wireshark
* VSCode, Postman, OWASP ZAP

### 🧪 Labs

* [TryHackMe: Pre-Security Path](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/presecurity)
* [OverTheWire: Bandit + Narnia](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)

### 📘 Deliverable

Create a simple **vulnerability report** after scanning your own VM.

---

## 🧩 Phase 2: Web Application Exploitation (Month 3–4)

> This is where things start getting fun.

### 🧠 Key Topics

* OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
* Authentication & session attacks
* Command injection, file uploads, insecure deserialization
* Bug bounty mindset

### 🧰 Tools

* Burp Suite Community/Pro
* OWASP ZAP
* Gobuster, Dirsearch, SQLMap, wfuzz

### 🧪 Labs

* [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security)
* [TryHackMe: Web Fundamentals](https://tryhackme.com/module/web-fundamentals)
* [VulnHub Labs](https://www.vulnhub.com/)

### 🧠 Challenge

Write a short **exploit chain**: login bypass → privilege escalation → data exfiltration.

---

## ⚙️ Phase 3: Privilege Escalation & OS Exploitation (Month 5–7)

> You’ve broken into a system — now what?

### 🧠 Key Topics

* Linux privilege escalation (SUID, cron jobs, misconfigs)
* Windows privilege escalation (token abuse, registry, services)
* Buffer overflows (basics)
* Shells & persistence

### 🧰 Tools

* LinPEAS, WinPEAS
* Metasploit, Empire, Netcat
* BloodHound (Active Directory)

### 🧪 Labs

* [TryHackMe: Linux PrivEsc](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxprivesc)
* [Hack The Box Machines](https://www.hackthebox.com)
* [VulnHub: Kioptrix Series](https://www.vulnhub.com/series/kioptrix,8/)

### 🎓 Certifications (Optional)

* [eJPT (INE/INE Security)](https://security.ine.com/certifications/ejpt-certification/)
* [OSCP (OffSec)](https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/)

---

## 🚀 Phase 4: Advanced Exploitation & Reporting (Month 8–12)

> Time to think like a professional tester.

### 🧠 Key Topics

* Active Directory exploitation
* Exploit development (intro)
* Post-exploitation, persistence, and reporting
* Engagement rules & ethics

### 🧰 Tools

* Cobalt Strike (demo or alternatives)
* CrackMapExec, Responder, Impacket
* PowerShell Empire, Covenant

### 🧪 Practice

* [Hack The Box Pro Labs](https://www.hackthebox.com/pro-labs)
* [AttackDefense Labs](https://attackdefense.com)
* [PentesterLab](https://pentesterlab.com)

### 📘 Deliverable

Build a **complete pentest report** for a mock client. Include:

* Executive Summary
* Vulnerability Findings
* Proof-of-Concept screenshots
* Recommendations

---

## 🧾 Portfolio Ideas

* 🧱 **DVWA Report** – Document vulnerabilities, PoCs, and fixes.
* 🕸️ **Custom Exploitation Script** – Python-based exploit or scanner.
* 🧰 **VulnHub Walkthroughs** – Write clean, markdown reports.
* 🎯 **Bug Bounty Blog Post** – Share lessons from a safe target (e.g., HackerOne practice).

> Remember: documentation + ethical mindset = credibility.

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* Don’t skip reporting — it’s half the job.
* Join **Discords:** TryHackMe, HackTheBox, Red Team Village.
* Read writeups, but only *after* you’ve tried yourself.
* Automate everything you repeat — your scripts are your toolkit.

**Goal:** become job-ready for **Junior Penetration Tester / Red Team Intern** roles within a year.
