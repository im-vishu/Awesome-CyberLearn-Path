## 🚀 What This Repo Is

**Awesome-CyberLearn-Path** is a curated, practical guide to mastering cybersecurity —  
combining structured learning paths, verified resources, and real-world project ideas.

Whether you want to become a **SOC Analyst, Penetration Tester, Threat Hunter, or Security Engineer**,  
this repo gives you the tools and roadmap to get there.

## 💡 Why I Built This

When I started learning cybersecurity, I realized most resources were scattered — some too basic, others too advanced.  
So I created this project to **help learners move step-by-step from zero to employable**, using real platforms, labs, and community tools.

If this helps you, consider giving it a ⭐ — that’s how we grow open knowledge together.
